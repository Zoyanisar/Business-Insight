**Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware is a hardware manufacturing company that sells various products to customers across different countries and regions. As a rapidly growing company, AtliQ Hardware faced the challenge of efficiently collecting and analyzing data from diverse sources such as SQL databases, Excel sheets, and CSV files. These hurdles potentially impeded their ability to make informed business decisions for sustained expansion and take timely corrective actions. Test - Develop an interactive report providing invaluable insights across finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive teams, using the provided mock-up dashboards as a reference.
